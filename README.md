1. Data Engineering

    ETL Pipelines: Designed and implemented Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipelines, which are core to data engineering. This includes handling data extraction from S3, data transformation with custom logic, and loading data into Redshift.

    Data Quality: Implementing data validation and cleaning processes ensures the integrity and quality of data before loading it into a data warehouse.

    Data Modeling: Creating and managing fact and dimension tables indicates strong knowledge of data modeling practices.

2. DevOps

    Monitoring: By incorporating Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization, this project established a robust monitoring system. This setup allows you to track the performance and health of ETL pipelines.

    Logging: Setting up ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging captures and analyze logs from  ETL processes, which is crucial for troubleshooting and auditing.

    Alerting: The system includes mechanisms for alerting (via email and potentially other channels) based on log data and metrics. This ensures timely responses to issues that might affect the data pipeline.

    Automation: Using Apache Airflow for orchestration demonstrates a DevOps approach to automate the execution and management of your ETL workflows, making them more reliable and scalable.

3. Full-Stack Data Integration and Analysis Project

End-to-End Solution: This project integrates various components from data extraction to final validation and reporting, encompassing both data engineering and DevOps elements.
This approach ensures not only that data is processed correctly but also that the infrastructure supporting this process is monitored, logged, and alerting in real-time.

This project exemplifies a full-stack approach to data engineering and DevOps. It covers:

- Building robust data pipelines (ETL processes).
- Ensuring data quality and integrity.
- Implementing monitoring and alerting systems for operational efficiency.
- Using logging and metrics to maintain and troubleshoot the data infrastructure.

This comprehensive setup is aligned with industry best practices for managing enterprise-level data systems, highlighting your project's depth in both data engineering and operational management.

STEPS 

1. Setting out aims and objectives of the project to make sure it meet stakeholders requirements to the letter.
2. designing the project architecture and data flow for the etl 
3. Investigating the data and designing the dimensional model to fit the business requirements in accordance to the aims and objectives of the project.
4. Initializing terraform as iaC to manage aws cloud resources and services needed.
5. aws configure to set aws credentials like access key and security key through the CLI
6. terraform init, terraform plan, terraform apply. 
7. Cross-check the resources created and test it is viable and in accordance with your data model.
8. A python script is then used to create the data-warehouse tables as outlined int the dimensional model. The scrispt makes use of 'Redshift-data' which is an API that lets you connect directly to your redshift as long as the aws CLI is appropraitely configured.
NOTE: you have to give the right permission to the IAM role or user used so it allows connection to Redshift and the API which is 'redshift-data'
NOTE: Using redshift-data API is a modern approach and safer and will not expose any of your credentials..
9. Once that is done and verified, you can then head to creating the actual etl pipeline.
